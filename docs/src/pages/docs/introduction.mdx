## Introduction

Welcome and thanks for checking out `react-form-ally`, a React hook that simplifies form handling in React applications.
`react-form-ally` provides developers with a simple and easy-to-use API to manage form state, validation, and
submission logic. It is highly customizable, and you can configure it to work with any form validation library or
schema. It is also framework-agnostic, and you can use it with any frontend framework or library that supports React.

Aside from providing a clear and concise way to manage form state, `react-form-ally` also provides a flexible way
to handle form validation. Developers can specify a validation schema via the `useForm` config, and the hook will
automatically validate the form values based on the specified schema. Validation can be performed on change, blur,
or submit events, and the hook supports debouncing validation to reduce performance overhead. The module itself
provides some built it validation, but also supports a plugin style validation. This allows you to roll your own
validation for your particular use case, or you can install one of the companion modules for using third-party validation
libraries. Currently this includes both `zod` and `yup`.

Additionally, this hook provides utilities for handling form submission and form resetting, as well as managing individual
form fields. Developers can easily set or update form field values, register form fields, and track which form fields
have been touched. This makes it easy to build complex forms with your validation requirements while keeping the code
readable and maintainable.

Overall, this hook helps reduce the amount of boilerplate code generally required for form management in a React
applications, all while improving code quality and maintainability. And of course its also written in TypeScript,
which means not only will you have gained the confidence of the additional type checking, you will also reap the
kind of DX that one should expect from any TS library.

**Note:**<br/>
It's always a good idea to evaluate multiple options before choosing a library or tool for your project.
Some factors to consider might include the size and complexity of your project, the specific requirements for your
form validation, and the level of customization and control you need over your form validation logic.
