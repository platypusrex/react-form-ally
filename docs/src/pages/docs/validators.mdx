# Validators

Validators are actually just simple functions that can be plugged into any instance of `useForm`. They provide a basic
set of rules or a schema for validating the form fields. `react-form-ally` supports this kind of API to allow maximum
flexibility for field validation, whether your rolling your own validation or using a third party library such as
[zod](https://zod.dev) or [yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup).

So far the documentation has only showcased hand-rolled validation. This section seeks to dive into some of our other
supported methods and modules. The `react-form-ally` module is packaged with it's own simple validator function, but
there are also modules for [zod](https://zod.dev) and [yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) that can be installed and
configured for use in your project.

Would you like to see additional support for a third-party validation library? Feel free to open an issue
